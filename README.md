# Build A Game Show App

## Software Summary

This is a game show app that allows you to guess a random phrase.  You can only select a letter once; if you select a total of 5 letters that aren't in the phrase, it's game over.  Whether you win or lose, the game will give you a chance to restart the whole thing with a random phrase once again.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*3/30/2018*  
* All of the JavaScript has been successfully run through JSHint; it only mentions some ES6 standards.
* I found a strange bug: if you double-click on the white space between the words of the random phrase, the whole phrase will reveal itself in highlights; if you click outside of the phrase, it will disappear once again.  I'll have to come back later to debug it and implement a solution.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank Team Treehouse for providing another great project idea through their "Front End Web Development" techdegree.  This whole process has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me.

I'd also like to thank them for providing the HTML and CSS on this project so that I could solely focus on the JavaScript aspect; it gave me a chance to really become familiar with manipulating the DOM and working with events.
