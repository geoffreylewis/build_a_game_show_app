## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank Team Treehouse for providing another great project idea through their "Front End Web Development" techdegree.  This whole process has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me.

I'd also like to thank them for providing the HTML and CSS on this project so that I could solely focus on the JavaScript aspect; it gave me a chance to really become familiar with manipulating the DOM.
